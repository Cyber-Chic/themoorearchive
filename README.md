### [ THE FIELD BRIEFING ]
**The Moore Archive is a living experiment designed to bridge the gap between digital patterns and the weight of the hand.**

This portal is the primary terminal for a global artifact hunt—a moving entity tethered to the physical earth by human hands and the frequency of the hunt. This is a personal creative labor; the signal exists only as long as the **Cycle of Honor** is maintained.

### [ 🛠️ OPERATIONAL SPECS ]
*   **AESTHETIC:** Digital Brutalism. A "Museum Cardstock" palette optimized for high-contrast focus.
*   **PRIVACY SIGNAL:** Zero-tracking architecture. This portal does not collect, store, or transmit user metadata.
*   **CORE LOGIC:** Specialized alphanumeric decryption, eye-comfort frequency toggles, and a desktop-locked interface.
*   **THE PROTOCOL:** Participation requires a **"Signal Refresh."** For every artifact found or month held, a secret act of kindness must be performed.

### [ 🛰️ SYNTHETIC CO-PILOT ]
**Technical Architecture:** This Archive was manifest through an iterative rhythmic exchange between **Angela N. Moore** and the **Gemini Neural Models** (via Google Search).

The vertical rhythm, specialized terminology, and eye-comfort logic were developed collaboratively—blending AI precision with human creative vision and design soul.
