# 📡 THE MOORE ARCHIVE (TMA)
### A Social-Performance Experiment in Physical-Digital Entanglement

> **"You are standing at the threshold of a living experiment."**

The Moore Archive is a metadata archive documenting the journey of a custom geocaching trackable and its accompanying art drops. It is a moving entity, tethered to the physical world through human interaction and the thrill of the hunt.

## 🧭 The Navigator's Quest

The digital vault is currently **LOCKED**. Entry is not granted through traditional means. To peer inside, you must track down the **Encryption Key**—a physical artifact currently roaming the wild.

1. **The Hunt:** Follow the artifact through the [Geocaching Network](https://www.geocaching.com).
2. **The Unlock:** Locate the alphanumeric code engraved on the physical object.
3. **The Entry:** Manually enter the code into the directory path: `Emaze.me/TMA/#THECODE`

*Note: Access is optimized for Desktop Interfaces. The vault remains closed to mobile explorers.*

## 🎨 Physical Artifact Drops (Material Disseminations)

The Archive occasionally "leaks" into the real world. These are free gifts to the community:
* **Official Prints & Replicas:** Hidden in Free Little Art Galleries (FLAGs).
* **Sector Leaks:** Locations are broadcasted via [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com).

## ⚖️ The Navigator's Oath (Protocols)

By interacting with the archive, you agree to the following directives:

*   **The 14-Day Rule:** If you find the Key, redeploy it within 14 days. Don't let the signal go cold.
*   **Digital Integrity:** Do not publish the code online. Do not attempt to exploit the project to bypass the hunt. **The journey is the art.**
*   **Signal Recovery:** Tag `@TheMooreArchive` on Instagram upon discovery to verify the signal is still alive.

## ☕ Mission Sustenance

TMA is a solo operation. These records exist through a labor of love. If you find value in the hunt, consider providing **Mission Sustenance** to say thanks for my work on this project.
