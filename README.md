# 📡 THE MOORE ARCHIVE (TMA)
### A Social-Performance Experiment in Physical-Digital Entanglement

> "You are standing at the threshold of a living experiment."

The Moore Archive (TMA) is a metadata archive documenting the journey of a custom geocaching trackable and its accompanying material disseminations. It is a moving entity, tethered to the physical world through human interaction and the thrill of the hunt.

## 🧭 The Navigator's Quest
The digital vault is currently **LOCKED**. Entry is not granted through traditional means. To peer inside, you must track down the **Encryption Key**—a physical artifact currently roaming the wild.

1. **The Hunt:** Follow the artifact through the [Geocaching Network](https://www.geocaching.com).
2. **The Unlock:** Locate the alphanumeric code engraved on the physical object.
3. **The Entry:** Manually enter the code into the directory path: `Emaze.me/TMA/#THECODE`

*Note: Access is optimized for **Desktop Interfaces**. The vault remains closed to mobile explorers.*

## 🎨 Physical Artifact Drops
The Archive occasionally "leaks" into the real world. These are free gifts to the community:
* **Official Prints & Replicas:** Hidden in [Free Little Art Galleries (FLAGs)](https://www.freelittleartgallery.art).
* **Sector Leaks:** Verified discoveries are tracked via Instagram.

## ⚖️ The Navigator's Oath (Protocols)
By interacting with the archive, you agree to the following directives:

* **The 14-Day Rule:** If you find the Key, redeploy it within 14 days. Don't let the signal go cold.
* **Digital Integrity:** Do not publish codes online or exploit the gallery for entry. The journey *is* the art. 
* **Signal Recovery:** Tag `@TheMooreArchive` on Instagram upon discovery with a photo for verification. For your safety, do not include faces or identifiable landmarks.
* **The Silent Signal:** Balance your discovery with an anonymous act of kindness. Do one good deed that remains entirely your secret.

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture
This repository contains the front-end archival structure for TMA.
* **Frontend:** HTML5 / CSS3 (Custom "Archival Paper" UI)
* **Typography:** Outfit & Space Mono
* **Status:** Best-effort hobby project.
