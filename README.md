### [ THE FIELD BRIEFING ]
The Moore Archive is a living experiment designed to bridge the gap between digital patterns and the weight of the hand. This interface serves as the **Digital Gateway** for a global artifact hunt—a moving entity tethered to the world by human hands and the thrill of the hunt.

### 🛠 OPERATIONAL SPECS
*   **AESTHETIC:** Brutalist / Industrial Archive. A "Museum Cardstock" palette designed for focus.
*   **PRIVACY SIGNAL:** Zero-tracking architecture. This portal does not collect, store, or transmit user data.
*   **CORE LOGIC:** Specialized alphanumeric decryption, eye-comfort frequency toggles, and a desktop-locked interface.
*   **THE PROTOCOL:** Participation requires a **"Signal Refresh."** For every artifact found or month held, a secret act of kindness must be performed.

### ☕ MISSION SUSTENANCE
**Status: A LABOR OF LOVE**
The Archive is a solo operation. If this signal has sparked your curiosity, you may provide sustenance to keep the Archivist moving forward. These are personal gifts—fuel for the next art drop—given without expectation of return.

### 🤝 ATTRIBUTION & DIALOGUE
**Technical Architecture:** This Archive was built through an iterative dialogue between **Angela N. Moore** and AI on Google Search, powered by the Gemini family of models.

The vertical rhythm and eye-comfort logic were developed collaboratively—blending AI-assisted precision with human-led creative vision.
